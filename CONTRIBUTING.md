## ðŸ’» How to Contribute

- **Bug Reports**:  
  Use the [Bug Report Template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) to submit any bugs you encounter. Clear, detailed reports help us maintain operational excellence.

- **Feedback Submissions**:  
  After completing project work, use the [Project Feedback Template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/project_feedback.md) to share reflections, lessons learned, and suggestions.

- **Code Improvements**:  
  Minor code improvements (e.g., typo corrections, non-functional refactoring) may be suggested through Pull Requests. Major changes require prior discussion through an Issue first.

- **Feature Requests**:  
  Submit an Issue labeled `enhancement` if you have an idea that aligns with ARKTIK's standards of faith-reason alignment and operational mastery.

## ðŸ’» Standards and Expectations

- **Operational Mastery**:  
  Write clean, readable, and efficient code. Follow Rust best practices and formatting guidelines.

  **Example**: Use descriptive variable names:
  ```rust
  // Good
  let loan_amount = 1000.0;
  
  // Avoid
  let x = 1000.0;
  ```

- **Commit Etiquette**:  
  Use meaningful commit messages that follow this format:  
  ```
  type: Short description (e.g., feat: Add loan calculation feature)
  ```
  Examples of types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`.

- **Branch Naming**:  
  If submitting a Pull Request, name your branches clearly:  
  ```
  feature/short-description
  bugfix/short-description
  improvement/short-description
  ```

- **Respectful Communication**:  
  All discussions, comments, and code reviews must be conducted with professionalism, humility, and clarity.
