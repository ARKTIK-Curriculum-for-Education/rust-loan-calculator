// ARKTIK Curriculum for Education (A.C.E.)
// Real-World Rust: Algebra in Action
// Project: Rust Loan Calculator — Powered by ARKTIK
// Course: Integrated Math I: Algebraic Foundations & Computational Logic (GT Track)

// Main Entry Point
fn main() {
    println!("Welcome to the Rust Loan Calculator — Powered by ARKTIK. Hidden Strength, Future Dominion.");

    // TODO: Future Development
    // - Step 1: Gather user input (loan amount, interest rate, loan term)
    // - Step 2: Perform accurate compound interest and monthly payment calculations
    // - Step 3: Display a comprehensive loan report with user-friendly formatting
}

// Additional Notes:
// This project introduces students to computational thinking and practical applications of algebra
// using Rust. By building real-world systems, students develop operational mastery and faith-driven
// stewardship.
