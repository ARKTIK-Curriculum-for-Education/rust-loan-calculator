## 💻 About This Repository

Welcome to **ARKTIK Curriculum for Education’s (A.C.E.)** first public proof-of-concept repository:  
a living demonstration of **faith-driven**, **execution-based** education — where operational excellence, innovation, and stewardship converge.

This project is designed for 6th–12th grade students in our **Gifted Track (GT)** and integrates **Algebraic Foundations** with **Computational Logic** through a real-world programming challenge.

## 💻 Project Overview: Real-World Rust | Loan Calculator

**Scenario:**  
_A trusted institution tasks you with building a reliable, user-friendly loan calculator to help clients calculate their monthly payments and financial obligations._

**What Students Will Build:**
- Input handling for loan parameters (principal, interest rate, term).
- Core mathematical logic for monthly payment calculations using compound interest formulas.
- A clean and intuitive command-line interface (CLI).
- Thoughtful error handling and data validation.
- Documentation and professional version control practices.

This project culminates in a **real-world application** that demonstrates operational mastery and produces portfolio-ready artifacts.

## 💻 Why This Matters

In today’s world, where education often prioritizes theoretical knowledge over practical competence, **ARKTIK Curriculum for Education** takes a different approach:

- Students must **build systems**, not just memorize concepts.
- Knowledge must **deliver operational outcomes**, not just test scores.
- Faith must **elevate execution**, inspiring discipline and stewardship.

This repository stands as a testament to the transformative power of combining **excellence, engineering, and faith** to create meaningful, impactful work.

## 💻 Key Values in Action

- **Operational Mastery**: Students develop precision and discipline by setting up and using professional tools like Rust and GitHub Codespaces.
- **Stewardship**: Every line of code and every step in the process reflects care and responsibility.
- **Integrity**: Mistakes are embraced as opportunities for growth, and every action is taken with honesty.
- **Faith-Reason Alignment**: The structured logic of Rust mirrors the broader principles of order and design in creation.
