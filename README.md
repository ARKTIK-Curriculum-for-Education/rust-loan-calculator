## About This Repository

Welcome to the first public proof-of-concept from **ARKTIK Curriculum for Education (A.C.E.)** â€”  
a demonstration of faith-driven, execution-based learning where operational mastery, innovation, and stewardship converge.

This repository supports **ACE-MA-R101-GT**, a Gifted Track course for 6thâ€“12th grade students, combining **Algebraic Foundations**, **Computational Logic**, and **Real-World Systems Building** using the Rust programming language.

This project marks **Lesson 1** of a larger educational journey. Students will ultimately contribute to the **ARKTIK Rust Agora**, a student-led marketplace of Rust-based systems for real-world impact.

## Project Overview: Real-World Rust | Loan Calculator (Lesson 1)

### Scenario:

A trusted institution tasks you, as a student engineer, with building a reliable, user-friendly loan calculator to help clients accurately determine monthly payments and financial obligations.

### What Students Will Build:
- Input handling for loan parameters (principal, interest rate, loan term).
- Core mathematical logic for monthly payment calculations using compound interest formulas.
- A clean and intuitive command-line interface (CLI).
- Thoughtful error handling and data validation.
- Documentation and professional version control practices.

This project culminates in a real-world operational artifact, laying the foundation for **future system builds** contributing to **the ARKTIK Rust Agora**.

---

## Why This Matters

In a world where education often prioritizes test scores over competence,  
**ARKTIK Curriculum for Education** requires something higher:

- Students build **operational systems**, not just memorize formulas.
- Knowledge produces **real outcomes**, not just theoretical proficiency.
- Faith inspires **discipline, stewardship, and resilience**.

This repository demonstrates that **excellence and faith are not opposing forces â€” they are twin engines for meaningful creation.**

## Key Values in Action

| Value               | How It Appears                                                   |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Operational Mastery** | Students work inside real Rust projects, setting up, building, and iterating. |
| **Stewardship**        | Every line of code and every design decision reflects personal and communal responsibility. |
| **Integrity**          | Errors are treated as opportunities for refinement, not as failure points. |
| **Faith-Reason Alignment** | Rustâ€™s structured logic mirrors the broader order of creation itself â€” students learn to build under both divine and mathematical order. |
