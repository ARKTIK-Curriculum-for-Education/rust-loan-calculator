## 💻 Student Reflection

Today, I discovered that algebra is more than just a classroom subject — it is a framework for building systems that solve real-world problems. Setting up the Rust environment required the same precision, organization, and logical thinking as solving an algebraic equation.

Writing my first Rust program reinforced the importance of intentionality. Every variable, calculation, and print statement needed to serve a purpose. Witnessing the program compile and execute successfully was deeply satisfying, as I realized that even the smallest errors could disrupt the entire system. This experience underscored the value of stewardship — taking care with every step to ensure success.

Operational mastery began with carefully following instructions for setting up my environment, including my `devcontainer`. It reminded me that excellence is achieved through deliberate, focused efforts rather than rushing or cutting corners.

Faith and reason naturally connected during this process. Both require clarity, discipline, and trust in systems greater than oneself. Programming in Rust mirrors this trust — when the language's rules are respected, the work becomes resilient and trustworthy.

## 💻 Key Operational Values Practiced
- **Operational Mastery**: Precisely setting up my development environment and successfully running my first program.
- **Stewardship**: Taking responsibility for each file, command, and step in the process.
- **Integrity**: Acknowledging and correcting errors during the setup process with diligence and honesty.
- **Faith-Reason Alignment**: Trusting the logical structure of Rust, much like trusting in the intentional design of creation.
